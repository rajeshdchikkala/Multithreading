MultiThreading Concepts

Thread: 
flow of control
is nothing but independent path of execution within a same program

creation of thread: 3 ways of creating thread
A) By extending thread class
B) By implementing runnable
C) By implementing callable

Q) why i should override run
Answer:-
Normal java execution tarts from main
thread flow starts from run method.

eg.line 8 if we call start method on t1 it will throw illegalthreadstatus exception. 
so disadvantages of using thread is not possible uisng extending thread and calling t1.start() again or twice.
As thread is dead we can't execute again.
in order to reuse thread threadpool concepts. 
there are 4 thread pool
1) fixed
2) cached
3)  scheduled thread 
4) single

Thread pool concepts:

Thread pool internally uses queue concepts.
Say i have 3 threads t1, t2 and t3.
and i have 10 employees whose salary need to be calculated.

inorder to use thread pool we know that executor framework
